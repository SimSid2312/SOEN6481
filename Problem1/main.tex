\subsection*{Function :  Natural logarithm of 2 i.e. $ln_e{2}$}
Definitions :\\
Irrational Numbers - are the numbers that cannot be represented as ratio or a fraction.\\
Natural Logarithm -  The natural logarithm of a number x is nothing but log to the base e of x. Here  e has a approximate value of 2.718.\\

$log_e{x}$ can be written as ln x

ln is called the natural log. The project is based on the natural logrithm of 2 ie. $ln_e{2}$ . \\
The value of $ln_e{2} \approx 0.69314718056$ and it is an irrational number i.e cannot be expressed in fractional form.

The proof of $ln_e{2}$ being irrational goes something like :\\
Let suppose, $ln_e{2}$ is rational i.e. there exist a x,y integers  $>0$ and they can represent the natural log of 2.\\
Therefore it can be said :\\ 
$ln_e{2}=x/y$\\
Applying exponential to both LHS and RHS , we get:\\
$e^{ln_e{2}}=e^{x / y}$\\
$2=e^{x / y}$\\
$2^y=e^{x}$\\

Since we know e is a transcendental number and from the theorm mentioned the famous book - "Proofs from the book" [1],Page 45, $e^r$ , where r is rational number not equal 0 , is irrational we can say that $ln_e{2}$ is also an irrational number i.e. cannot be denoted as ratio of two integers with value $>0$. The understanding of the proof was gathered from the website [2] - concept explained by Richard Morris, Maths tutor, doctorate in mathematics/computer science.
